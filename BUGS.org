* TODO <2013-04-12 Fri> Parser for KTH does not like if ":" has no space

  If we try to Parse the following files 

  : 2

  : 2 :1

  or

  or

  it fails.
* TODO <2013-09-06 Fri> Check why pebbling on binary trees does not work
  
  When I computed the reversible  pebbling number for the binary trees
  of height 2 it gave me 5. Should not be 4?
  
* TODO <2013-09-06 Fri> Am I hashing the pebbling configuration correctly?

  Configuration  with  the  same  black and  white  pebbles  but  with
  different “useful_pebbles” vector are considered equivalent.
